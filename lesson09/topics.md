* Declare a point to int using a style more compliant with C syntax: put the `*` near the variable,
not near the type.
* Set a pointer to the address of a local variable on stack.
* Change the pointed object via a pointer.
  * The type of pointer is important when we have to change the pointed object 'cause
the compiler knows how big is the object pointed by the pointer via the pointer type.
* Pointer syntax equivalence with arrays.
* Passing a pointer to a function.
