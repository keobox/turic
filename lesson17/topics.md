# Topics

* Use this lesson to solve some doubts arose in Lesson 16.
* Explain what is `char *str` in a struct: is a pointer to a string.
* If I write `str[20]` now C consider this, in the struct, as an
integer followed by 20 chars. No pointer is present. So, in this case,
there's no equivalence among `char *s` and `char s[]` like in other
contexts.
* Complete the `hexdump` function using the ternary operator.
