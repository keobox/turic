# Topics

* Recap of what done in lesson 14 about `fract.c`.
* Intention: implement the `tac` command that prints the reverse of `cat` command.
* Explain program `args`.
* Explain the `FILE` C API: file pointers and `fopen`.
  * `man fopen`.
* Explain the `fgets` function for reading the lines of a file.
* Write a `Linked List` of strings struct to print the strings of a file
in reverse order.
* A last comment: in this case we wrote a `Linked List` abstraction and
a O(N) algorithm to print in reverse but using a O(N) memory where
N is the lines number.
