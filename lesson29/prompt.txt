This is a work in progress program for a very small and simple FORTH interpreter
(actually it's a FORTH like interpreter, not really a fork).
I understand there are missing parts, such as ctxSetError(), stack frames and
so forth. However please tellme if you can spot any obvious bug in what is already written.
