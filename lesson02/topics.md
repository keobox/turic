# Topics

* gcc warnings flags.
* String formatting.
* 'printf' is variadic accepts many arguments.
* Any warning can generate an undefined behavior.
* 'main' is a special function, everything starts here.
* If 'main' is not there we get a linked error.
* Local variable initialization.
* Local variable declaration and then assignment.
* Arguments variables are local.
* Integer value returned from main is the unix error code of a program.

## Appendix video
* How local variables works.
* 6502 microprocessor works, using "Easy 6502" web site.
* Local variables in assembly: microprocessor registries.
* Local variables live in registries and these are saved in a stack.
* Many compilers follow conventions about how to call a function.
* This convention is very clear for 386 architecture.
* Explains what is a stack: it's a piece of memory.
* Explains the SP, stack pointer, and push and pop instructions.
* Push pushes a value of a register in the stack.
* Pop a value from the stack (and remove it from that).
* Program counter and how saved in stack on a call.
* How local variables are pushed to the stack before call.
* 386 asm program used is "Compiler Explorer".
* Conclusion: local variable are temporary registries or temporary values in the stack.
