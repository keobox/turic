# Topics

* Mathematics of pointers.
* Start from lesson 9 code.
* Equivalence of pointer deferencing forms `*p = p[0]`.
* Deferencing works also for reading the pointed value.
* Again on `&` address operator and assign to a pointer.
* Note: all pointers are just numbers, the size of these numbers is the same
of the address BUS of the microprocessor.
* Pointer of pointer and prove a pointer as an address itself.
* Size of pointers with this microprocessor.
* Casting to int.
* In C the an array variable is equivalent to a pointer, hence can be assigned to a pointer.
  * There's no need to use the `&` operator durin assignment.
