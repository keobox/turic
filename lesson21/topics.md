- Is time to talk about `union`, `bitfield`, `function pointers`.
- A more "regular" way to init a struct.
- `memcopy` is in `string.h` for historical reasons.
- Using an union, now `i` is an integer representation and `a` is
a byte representation, note that if `10` is the first number
then the CPU is `little endian` the least significative byte is
the first.
